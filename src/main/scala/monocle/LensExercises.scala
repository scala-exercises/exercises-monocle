/** == Lens ==
 *
 * A [[http://julien-truffaut.github.io/Monocle/optics/lens.html Lens]] is an optic used to zoom inside a `Product`, e.g. `case class`, `Tuple`, `HList` or even `Map`.
 * `Lenses` have two type parameters generally called `S` and `A`: `Lens[S, A]` where `S` represents the `Product` and `A` an element inside of `S`.
 *
 * Letâ€™s take a simple case class with two fields:
 * {{{
 *   case class Address(strNumber: Int, streetName: String)
 * }}}
 *
 * We can create a `Lens[Address, Int]` which zooms from an `Address` to its field `strNumber` by supplying a pair of functions:
 *
 *  - `get: Address => Int`
 *  - `set: Int => Address => Address`
 *
 * {{{
 *   import monocle.Lens
 *   val strNumber = Lens[Address, Int](_.strNumber)(n => a => a.copy(strNumber = n))
 * }}}
 *
 * This case is really straightforward so we automated the generation of `Lenses` from case classes using a macro:
 * {{{
 *   import monocle.macros.GenLens
 *   val strNumber = GenLens[Address](_.strNumber)
 * }}}
 *
 * @param name lens

  /**
   * == Laws ==
   *
   * A `Lens` must satisfy all properties defined in `LensLaws` from the core module. You can check the validity of your own `Lenses` using `LensTests` from the law module.
   *
   * In particular, a Lens must respect the `getSet` law which states that if you get a value `A` from `S` and set it back in, the result is an object identical to the original one. A side effect of this law is that set must only update the `A` it points to, for example it cannot increment a counter or modify another value.
   *
   * On the other hand, the `setGet` law states that if you `set` a `value`, you always `get` the same value back. This law guarantees that `set` is actually updating a value `A` inside of `S`.
